The Human Development Index uses life expectancy, GDP, and years of schooling as indicators from countries to assess the development of a
country [1]. Our project isolates the life expectancy component of this index and questions what indicators influence it the greatest. The Australian
Department of Health states that life expectancy is influenced by factors such as “socioeconomic status, including employment, income, education
and economic wellbeing; the quality of the health system and the ability of people to access it; health behaviours such as tobacco and excessive
alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and lack of exercise; social factors; genetic factors; and environmental factors including overcrowded housing,
lack of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation [2].” With this knowledge, data related to these factors were extracted from the World Bank
database.
